The main goal purpose of this app is to create an app which uses the device's camera / light sensors to measure light value and then use algorithms to calculate Shutter speed and Aperture based on the film roll's ISO. 
There will be 2 mode:

 - AP : Aperture priority - Calculates only the Shutter speed.
 - TV : Shutter priority - Calculates the Aperture required.

Features on future implementation:

 - [ ] EV (Exposure value) - Adjusted manually
 - [ ] EV - Bracketing
 - [ ] Star trails calculation.
 - [ ] Blur detector for moving objects.
